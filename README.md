CI-CD-Pipeline-for-Python-Flask-Application-using-Jenkins-and-AWS

This is a Python Flask-based web application that lets users play Tic Tac Toe either against the computer or with friends.
The project uses HTML templates for the game interface (home.html, play_computer.html, play_friends.html) and integrates with a backend Flask server to handle game logic.
A CI/CD pipeline is implemented using Jenkins and GitHub webhooks, deploying the app to an AWS EC2 instance via Gunicorn for production-grade performance.
